MeritCommons Release 2016.12 Changelog
===================================

MeritCommons 2016.12 is an infrastructure-focused housekeeping release with most open source dependencies being updated as part of a switch from our CentOS 6.8 based images that included the "MeritCommons System" tarball, to a new Ubuntu 16.04 HVM AMI with the distribution providing almost all binary packages.

## A brief summary of these upgrades

* Mojolcious from 6.x to 7.x
* SphinxSearch from 2.1.5 to 2.2.9
* PostgreSQL from 9.3.2 to 9.5.5

## Paid-Off Technical Debt and An Overhauled Development Environment

We also focused on refining the new repository hierarchy introduced in MeritCommons 2016.09, including enhancements changes to `prepare_meritcommons.pl`, and a Docker-based development environment that is aware of the new methodology.  Including the new `morbo-meritcommons-inotify` which is a refactoring of Mojolicious' `morbo` command that relies on Linux's `inotify` kernel level file change notifications.

The [MeritCommons Docker Tools](https://git.meritcommons.io/meritcommons/docker-tools) come with a Dockerfile that builds an environment is almost identical to the production environment.  The docker-tools repository is also a Docker Container registry, so that docker image can be downloaded pre-built from git.meritcommons.io as well.

2016.12 also includes `meritcommons-hypnotoad` which is a customized version of Mojolicious' preforking production server hypnotoad.

In preparation for the UI-centric 2017.03 and 2017.06 we've upgraded all front-end JavaScript libraries and Bootstrap framework to the newest versions.

All of these infrastructure changes add up to a system that is faster and more stable than ever before.

## The following bugfixes and features were implemented in 2016.12
