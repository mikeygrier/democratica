#  MeritCommons Release 2016.09 Changelog

MeritCommons 2016.09 is primarily a bugfix release with several enhancements made along the way.  Since this is the first release in the
quarterly release pattern. please note that the September (09) and January (01) releases will have minimal UI and feature refinements, whereas the 
March (03) and June (06) releases may introduce large new features and radical user interface changes. 

As such _2016.09_ focuses primarily on back end integration code and small interface tweaks and improvements.  Several enhancements have been 
made to the mostly invisible ``CasServer``, ``SAML2``, and ``OAuth2`` plugins, and the back end scaling system.

## Changes to repository hierarchy

A big part of this first release includes a refactoring of how MeritCommons is deployed to end user clients.  Clients will no longer maintain a 
fork of core and the plugins repositories, they will instead have a repository called *common*, which will include all of the client's customizations
that are common across all environments, and one or more environment specific repositories that will contain the client's configuration data 
including config files, RSA keys for SSO and TLS, and plugin configuration files.  To make this process easy for administrators to manage, a 
script called ``prepare_meritcommons.pl`` will be included in the ``~/bin/`` directory of every client's installation, it depends on properly 
setting three envirionment variables:

 * ``ACADEDMICA_CUSTOMER_BASE`` which should be set to the base of the customer's git.meritcommons.io repo,
to enable us to use SSH keys and not have to store credentials please use the "ssh" version.  For example, Wayne State University's base would
be ``git@git.meritcommons.io:wayne-state``.
 * ``MERITCOMMONS_CUSTOMER_ENVIRONMENT`` for the time being this will usually be set to ``production``
 * ``MERITCOMMONS_DEPLOY_BRANCH`` to run the latest release set this to ``latest-release``, to run bleeding edge code, set this to ``master``, you can also choose specific releases, to run this current release you would use ``release-2016.09``

We will have set most of this up for you, practically speaking, the biggest impact these changes will have on customers is where customizations are made and how to get those customizations pushed into their environment.  All functionality and content changes should be made in your ``common`` repository, which works much like your ``plugins`` repo used to work, except it will only contain your own plugins.   Configuration changes should be made in your ``$environment`` (e.g. ``production``) repository instead of directly editing configuration on the server.  Finally, to get your changes in place, instead of running ``git pull`` in various places and then running ``meritcommons flock update``, the "new" way is ``cd /usr/local/meritcommons && prepare_meritcommons.pl && meritcommons flock update``.  Please note `prepare_meritcommons.pl` must be run from /usr/local/meritcommons (or wherever you have MeritCommons installed).  It will warn you if you are not in that folder but if you ignore the warning it will prepare the current folder as if it _were_ /usr/local/meritcommons.

### Changes to MeritCommons Core

 * Added a general purpose "Loading" page to be used as an intermediate step when loading external applications that may take a long time
   to respond.
 * Improved debugging output in the ``LDAPAuth`` and ``Hydrant`` subsystems, including client-side JS console debugging when MeritCommons is
   running in debug mode.
 * Found and closed several CSRF attack vectors as part of a security audit
 * Improved UTF-8 support
 * Improvements to stream creation and modification errors (errors are now in plain english and do not contain debug information)
 * Buttons on stream pages now match the style of other buttons in MeritCommons
 * Users can now edit messages (messages are denoted as editted and the original author is notified of any edits)
 * MeritCommons administrators are now notified when a user makes a request for MeritCommonscoins (this will allow administrators to respond to requests in a more timely manner)
 * Users are now directed to the MeritCommonscoin interface when attempting to make a promotional message with an insufficient amount of coins

### Architectural Changes to MeritCommons Core

 * sync_assets_to_external command is now aware of plugin assets and syncs them properly over the base assets
 * window.afterMain[] array created as a means to load and call client side methods, which can be used like this:
<pre>
    &lt;script&gt;
        window.afterMain.push(function() {
           // define your custom backbone view (or load it from elsewhere)
           define('my_custom_lib', [
               '<%= $self->asset_url("js/my_custom_lib.js") %>',
           ], function(my_custom_lib) {
               return my_custom_lib;
           });

           // initialize your custom backbone view
           require([
               'my_custom_lib'
           ], function(whateverThisIs) {
               whateverThisIs = new whateverThisIs();
               return whateverThisIs;
           });
       &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
 * Made the ChangeLog database more robust, and made use of it in more places

### Changes to ``CasServer`` Plugin

 * Handle log out situations more appropriately
 * Provide more context to external authentication providers about what applications are being logged in to / out of

### Changes to ``SAML2`` Plugin

 * The ability to import, update, and index the entire InCommon metadata XML, comprising over 6000 federation agreements
